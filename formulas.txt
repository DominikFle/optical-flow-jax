Optical Flow:
Constraint Equation:
    I_x * u + I_y * v + I_t = 0 ---> underdetermined system of equations
    where I_x, I_y, I_t are the gradients of the image in x, y and t directions respectively.
    The gradients are calculated as follows:
    I_x = (I(x+1, y) - I(x-1, y)) / 2
    I_y = (I(x, y+1) - I(x, y-1)) / 2
    I_t = I(x, y, t+1) - I(x, y, t-1)
    where I(x, y, t) is the intensity of the image at pixel (x, y) at time t.
Lucas-Kanade Method:
Least Squares for Patches W of size nxn:
    A=[I_x_i, I_y_i] where I_x_i, I_y_i are the spacial gradients (I el of nxn) of the patch W
    now for each patch we have
    A * [u, v] = -I_t_i
    where I_t_i is the temporal gradient of the patch W
    [u, v] = (A^T * A)^-1 * A^T * -I_t_i
    where u, v are the optical flow vectors for the patch W
